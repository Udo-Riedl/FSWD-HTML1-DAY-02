		After John Wick killed Santino D’Antonio at the Continental, he is fleeing through New York. With an initial $ 14 million bounty on him and the murder of D'Antonio depriving him of all the privileges he had been granted as a member of the Continental, he is now trying to get out of New York City escape. He reaches the city library and fetches a crucifix chain with an “exchange medallion” from a hidden book. In the library, John is attacked by an assassin before the deadline, which he can overcome, though seriously injured. John rushes to a well-known doctor who treats his injury. At 6 p.m. he is "excommunicated" and all the killers in the city hunt for him. On the run from assassins, he fights his way to the Tuchowski Theater, where he visits the director, a woman from the past who accepts the crucifix as a ticket for the safe crossing to Essaouira near Casablanca in Morocco.
