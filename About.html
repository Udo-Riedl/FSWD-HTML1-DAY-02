John Wick (Keanu Reeves) enjoys his early retirement in the suburbs. But when his wife (Bridget Moynahan) succumbs to a fatal illness, he falls into grief. Only his dog remains as a companion - and is killed by three Russian gangsters when they break into Wick's house to steal a 1969 Boss Mustang. Wick's dark past catches up with him, as he used to be one of the best contract killers in the country. He leaves the suburban idyll and, looking for his revenge, goes in search of the burglars. One of them is Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen), the son of the influential crime boss Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist), for whom Wick had once worked. But old connections no longer count. And so the avenger will soon have ex-colleague Marcus (Willem Dafoe) on his heels ...
