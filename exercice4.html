<div> 
<p>
<span>
Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
<div>
That is how I know you go on.
</div>
Far across the distance
<span>
And spaces between us
</span>
You have come to show you go on
</span>
</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
Near...
Far...
Wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more...
You open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on
</div>
<br>
<div>
Love can touch us one time
And last for a lifetime
And never let go till we're gone
Love was when I loved you
One true time I hold to
In my life we'll always go on
</div>
<br>
<div>	
Near...
Far...
Wherever you are
I believe that
The heart does go on
Once more...
You open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on
</div>
<br>
<div>
You're here
There's nothing I fear
And I know that
My heart will go on
We'll stay
Forever this way
You are safe in my heart
And my heart will go on and on
</div>
